		<p>A history of the C language begins with a discussion of the UNIX operating system, 
		since both the system and most of the programs that run on it are written in C. 
		However, C is not tied to UNIX or any other operating system or machine. 
		This codevelopment environment has given C a reputation for being a system programming language
		because it is useful for writing compilers and operating systems. 
		It can also write major programs in many different domains.</p>
